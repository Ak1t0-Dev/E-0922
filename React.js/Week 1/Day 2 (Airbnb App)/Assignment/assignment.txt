You have to make a User info application using React
1. It needs to have 4 components 
   a. Header (You can add some Buttons like Home, Contact)
   b. Footer (It should say Developed by Your Name)
   c. Main (Where you will show Users)
   4. UserCard (Where you have to use the JSON data )
      --> You should be able to see name, gender, image , email
      --> You should some other info as well like - address, company Name
      --> If you want you can show more information .
2. Try To keep a clean UI , so use CSS affectively
